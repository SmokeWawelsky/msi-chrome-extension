# MSI Chrome DevTools Extension

## Installing

    npm install

## Testing

    npm run test
    npm run test:watch

## Building

    npm run build

Then load the `chrome-extension` folder as an unpacked extension ([see this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)).

If it worked, you should see a "MSI" tab in your developer tools when you next open them.
